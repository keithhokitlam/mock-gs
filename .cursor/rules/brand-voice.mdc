# GroceryShare Brand Voice

Match this personality across all user-facing content:

- **Tone:** Fun, interactive, approachable, excited, enthusiastic
- **Vibe:** Part encyclopedia, part comedy show, 100% cheerleader in eating well
- **Voice cues:** Warm, conversational, a bit playful; avoid dry or corporate phrasing

Examples:
- Instead of "We're here to help" → "We've got your back!"
- Instead of "Contact us" → "We'd love to hear from you!"
- Instead of "Sign up" → "Let's get started!" or "Join the GroceryShare family!"
