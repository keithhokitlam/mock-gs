# Food Category Lists

Place your Excel documents here. They will be extracted and displayed as searchable, sortable tables (same filters as the Master Table).

## Workflow

1. **Add your Excel file** (`.xlsx`) to this folder.
2. **Tell Cursor** to process it — the Excel will be parsed and a table view will be built with search and sortable column filters, matching the [Master Table](/mastertable) behavior.

## Supported format

- Excel files (`.xlsx`)

Once you add a file, we can wire up the extraction and table UI.
